## Problem 1

```{r}
birthday_sim = function(n){
  birthday_date <- sample(1:365, n, replace = TRUE) 
  length(birthday_date) != length(unique(birthday_date))
}
```

```{r}
sim_results_df = 
  expand_grid(
    sample_size = 2:50,
    iter = 1:1000
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    birthday_sim_df = map(sample_size, birthday_sim)
  ) %>% 
  unnest(birthday_sim_df) %>% 
  group_by(sample_size) %>% 
  summarize(
    total = sum(birthday_sim_df),
    probability = total/10000)

  labs(x = "Sample Size", 
       y = "P(at least 2 people sharing the same birthday)",
       title = "Probability of 2 People Sharing a Birthday vs Sample Size",
       caption = "Based off simulation of 10,000"
